# Pr√°cticas IFCA
GitHub containing the used codes and plots made for my intership at IFCA.

The main goal of this internship has been to colaborate in the development and characterization of a calibration source boarded in a LEO orbit satellite, in order to calibrate terrestrial experiments of the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

The orbit of the calibration satellite (CalSat) can be found at folder 'Orbits' with different durations. The file 'main.py' generates the plot that can be found on folder 'Pyhton Plots' and counts how many times CalSat orbits above (or in the filed of view of) each of the studied experiemnts (QUIJOTE, CLASS, ACT and LSPE-STRIP). You can also find a plot of how the inclination angle changes against altitude for a Sun Synchronus Orbit ('SSO.pdf') and how the elevation angle changes against altitude at the South Pole, where the South Pole Telescope (SPT) is.
